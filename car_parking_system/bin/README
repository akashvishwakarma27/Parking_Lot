# Car Parking System

This project implements a car parking system in Java using object-oriented principles. The system can accommodate different types of vehicles and supports a configurable cost strategy. It provides functionalities such as initializing the parking lot, adding and removing vehicles, checking availability of vehicle spaces, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following packages:

- `com.parking.model`: Contains classes representing the core models of the parking system, such as vehicles, floors, parking lot, and vehicle spaces.
- `com.parking.service`: Contains the `ParkingService` class which provides methods to interact with the parking lot.
- `com.parking`: Contains the `Main` class which demonstrates the usage of the parking lot and its methods.

## Classes

- `CostStrategy`: Represents the cost strategy for parking, providing a method to calculate parking cost.
- `Floor`: Represents a floor in the parking lot with attributes like floor number, capacity for each vehicle type, and vehicle spaces.
- `ParkingLot`: Represents the parking lot and manages floor instances.
- `Vehicle`: Represents a vehicle with attributes such as registration number and type.
- `VehicleSpace`: Represents a space for a vehicle with attributes like space number, availability, and vehicle type.
- `ParkingService`: Provides methods to interact with the parking lot, such as parking a vehicle, removing a vehicle, and checking token validity.
- `Main`: Contains the main method to demonstrate the usage of the parking lot and its methods.

## Usage

1. Initialize the parking lot using the `ParkingService` constructor, specifying the number of floors and spaces per floor.
2. Use the `parkVehicle` method of `ParkingService` to add vehicles to the parking lot.
3. Use the `removeVehicle` method of `ParkingService` to remove vehicles from the parking lot.
4. Use the `isTokenValid` method of `ParkingService` to check the validity of a token.

## Testing

The `Main` class provides a sample usage scenario demonstrating the functionalities of the parking system. You can test the project further by adding more vehicles, removing vehicles, and observing the behavior under various scenarios.
